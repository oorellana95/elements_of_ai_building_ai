"""
Exercise 14 (intermediate): Training data vs test data

The program estimates the coefficients of a linear regression model (array c) from the following data:
https://buildingai.elementsofai.com/Machine-Learning/linear-regression

Use the predicted coefficients to obtain price estimates for the following two cabins:

Note that the predicted prices will not be the same as the actual prices (which are given in the above table just for
comparison â€“ you won't need them in the exercise).
